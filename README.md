It's an early pre pre alpha version of the compiler, recently really unstable!

It's a really simple compiler or a compressor program that I made for the upcoming Js13kGames JavaScript coding competition.
If you are interested in it, you can read more here:

The idea:
Program require your index.html file as parameter, and simple compress all your inline js, and js files using Closure Compiler app. 
The script also do this all the css codes and las it compress the html code.  

My TODO list is very-very long but I'm hope I will able to finish it in time.

Some other useful features I willing to make:
- project.json so you have to once create it and you after everything work automatically
- compress singe js/css files
- image compress
